## Python Program to Add Two Numbers
This Python program demonstrates two methods for adding two numbers:

### Method 1: Using Pre-defined Variables
In this method, two pre-defined variables (`num1` and `num2`) are assigned with numeric values (in this case, `20` and `10`). The sum of these two numbers is then calculated and printed to the console using the `print` statement.

### Method 2: User Input for Dynamic Calculation
In this method, the program prompts the user to input two numeric values, either integers or floating-point numbers. The `float()` function is used to convert the user input to floating-point numbers, allowing for the addition of both integer and decimal values. The sum is then calculated and displayed using the `print` statement.

### Example Output
For both methods, the result is printed to the console, showcasing the sum of the given numbers.
This simple program serves as an introductory example for basic arithmetic operations in Python and demonstrates the use of both pre-defined variables and user input for dynamic calculations.

## Python Program to Calculate Square Root
This Python program illustrates two methods to calculate the square root of a given integer:

### Method 1: Using the `math` Module
The program utilizes the `math` module, which provides a `sqrt()` function. In this method, the user is prompted to input an integer, and the square root of the entered number is calculated using the `math.sqrt()` function. The result is then printed to the console.

### Method 2: Using Exponential Operator
In this method, the program prompts the user to input an integer. The square root is calculated using the exponential operator (`**`), with the exponent set to `0.5`. This method demonstrates an alternative approach to calculating the square root without relying on external modules. The result is printed to the console.

### Example Output
For both methods, the program prints the square root of the entered integer to the console.
This program serves as a simple example to showcase different approaches for calculating the square root in Python.

## Python Program to Swap Two Variables
This Python program demonstrates two methods for swapping the values of two variables.

### Method 1: Using a Temporary Variable
1. Two variables (`var1` and `var2`) are initialized with numeric values.
2. The values of the variables are displayed before the swap.
3. A temporary variable (`temp_var`) is used to store the value of `var1`.
4. The value of `var1` is then updated with the value of `var2`.
5. Finally, the value of `var2` is updated with the value stored in the temporary variable.
6. The program displays the values of the variables after the swap.

### Method 2: Without Using a Temporary Variable
1. Two variables (`var1` and `var2`) are initialized with numeric values.
2. The values of the variables are displayed before the swap.
3. The values of `var1` and `var2` are swapped directly using a tuple unpacking assignment (`var1, var2 = var2, var1`).
4. The program displays the values of the variables after the swap.

### Example Output
For both methods, the program prints the values of the variables before and after the swap, demonstrating the swapping of variable values.

    - If the remainder is zero, the number is classified as an even number.
    - If the remainder is not zero, the number is classified as an odd number.
3. The program prints the result based on the classification.

This Python program determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.

### Method:
1. The program prompts the user to input a year as an integer.
2. Using conditional statements, the program checks the conditions for a leap year:
    - If the year is divisible by 400 and also divisible by 100, it is a leap year.
    - If the year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, it is a leap year.
    - If the year does not meet the above conditions, it is not a leap year.
3. The program prints the result based on the leap year classification.

### Method:
1. The program prompts the user to input three numbers as floating-point values.
2. Using conditional statements, the program compares the numbers to find the largest one:
    - If `num1` is greater than both `num2` and `num3`, then `num1` is the largest.
    - If `num2` is greater than both `num1` and `num3`, then `num2` is the largest.

## Python Program to Check if a Number is Prime
This Python program determines whether a given integer is a prime number or not.

### Method:
1. The program prompts the user to input an integer.
2. The program checks if the input is equal to 1. If so, it declares that 1 is not a prime number.
3. If the input is greater than 1, the program uses a `for` loop to iterate from 2 to the input number (exclusive).
4. Inside the loop, the program checks if the input number is divisible by any number in the iteration range.
    - If it is divisible, the program declares that the number is not a prime number and breaks out of the loop.
5. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, the program declares that the number is a prime number.
6. The program prints the result based on the prime number classification.
